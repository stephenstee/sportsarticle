           <p>It was the end of March, and Josh Fiske, a urologist from Livingston, N.J., was in the hospital fighting an uphill battle against the coronavirus. Just a week earlier, he had easily jogged a five-mile route around his neighborhood. But his body was failing him now.

            His oxygen levels dipped dangerously low, and his fever rocketed to a worrying 104 degrees. Shifting his body in bed exhausted him. Walking a few steps felt like “hiking in thin air.” Opening a bottle of iced tea was “a huge task.”
            
            Fiske kept fighting, though, and eventually, with the help of his doctors, he turned a corner. Yet even as he did, even as he seemed assured of avoiding the worst outcomes of the virus, a different sort of anxiety consumed him.
            
            “I started to think, ‘Am I going to be able to run again? Am I going to be able to walk the golf course?’” said Fiske, 46, who does a marathon or half-marathon every year. “These are things I love to do.”</p>

            <p>The Champions League final, one of sport’s most-watched annual events, will not be held at its planned site, Istanbul, amid the ongoing crisis brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.

            European soccer’s governing body UEFA, the event’s organizer, is now considering a number of alternative venues as it plans to complete the competition, which was part way through its round of 16 stage when — like most other sporting events — it paused indefinitely.
            
            Now with national leagues starting to emerge to complete their seasons, UEFA is concluding talks on how to finish the Champions League and its secondary Europa League in August. The Europa League final had been set to be held in Gdansk, Poland. A decision will be made after a meeting of the executive committee on June 17, said the person, who declined to speak publicly because talks on the alternative sites are ongoing.
            
            UEFA will hold further talks with Turkish officials next week, to finalize an agreement to move the event. Istanbul could be picked to host the final at a later date.</p>
          <p>Leagues that have restarted, or are planning to restart, are adopting severe hygiene protocols to ensure games can be played again safely while the virus continues to be a danger. UEFA is certain to adopt similar strategies, meaning that the games are being planned to take place in empty stadiums and that the players involved will face regular tests. With European travel limited, and ongoing quarantine laws in some countries, it is also likely that most of the remaining games will take place in the place picked to host the final.

            The Spanish news media reported that UEFA was planning to host this year’s Champions League final, an event that draws more viewers globally than the Super Bowl, in Lisbon. There are a small number of other candidates, according to the person with knowledge of the matter.</p>
          <p>“A working group has been set up with the participation of representatives from the leagues and clubs to examine calendar solutions and format options that would allow for the completion of the current season,” said a UEFA spokesman. “A variety of options is being looked at and no decisions have been made at this stage.”</p>
          <p>What’s certain is the competition is unlikely to look like anything that has gone before, with calendar constraints necessitating it be completed in as short a time possible to allow players to rest before starting next season in September. The original date for the final at Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul was May 30.

            “A working group has been set up with the participation of representatives from the leagues and clubs to examine calendar solutions and format options that would allow for the completion of the current season,” said a UEFA spokesman. “A variety of options is being looked at and no decisions have been made at this stage.</p>
            <p>UEFA’s television contract for the Champions League is one of the richest in sports, with most of that income being paid out in prize money to teams participating in its tournaments. Last season it paid nearly 2 billion euros to participating teams.

                Should it not be able to complete the tournament, UEFA faces paying a ruinous rebate worth hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>

          <p>If May was the amuse-bouche of the sports menu, June looks set to provide an honest-to-goodness appetizer. And while the main courses may be some way off, there should be plenty for hungry fans to take in.

            All right, it’s time to quickly drop that metaphor and get to the sports.</p>
          <h5>Horse Racing</h5>
          <p>The first jewel of the Triple Crown will be run on June 20, but it won’t be the Kentucky Derby. Instead the Belmont Stakes, normally run third in the sequence, will kick things off.

            But the race won’t look the same as in years past. No fans will pack Belmont’s sweeping grandstands. And with 3-year-old horses having had limited options to race, organizers have decided that asking them to go the Belmont’s famed grueling 1½ miles was too much this year. Instead they will race at a mere 1⅛ miles, making the Belmont the shortest, instead of the longest, Triple Crown race.
            
            Whoever wins the Belmont will have to wait some time to complete the Triple Crown. The Kentucky Derby is set for September and the Preakness for October.</p>

<p>What’s certain is the competition is unlikely to look like anything that has gone before, with calendar constraints necessitating it be completed in as short a time possible to allow players to rest before starting next season in September. The original date for the final at Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul was May 30.

 “A working group has been set up with the participation of representatives from the leagues and clubs to examine calendar solutions and format options that would allow for the completion of the current season,” said a UEFA spokesman. “A variety of options is being looked at and no decisions have been made at this stage.</p>
 <p>UEFA’s television contract for the Champions League is one of the richest in sports, with most of that income being paid out in prize money to teams participating in its tournaments. Last season it paid nearly 2 billion euros to participating teams.

     Should it not be able to complete the tournament, UEFA faces paying a ruinous rebate worth hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>

<h1>June: Sports Are Busting Out All Over</h1>
<p>Horse racing, golf, soccer and auto racing are coming back in June. Fans may have to wait a bit longer for hockey, baseball and basketball, though.</p>

<p>If May was the amuse-bouche of the sports menu, June looks set to provide an honest-to-goodness appetizer. And while the main courses may be some way off, there should be plenty for hungry fans to take in.

 All right, it’s time to quickly drop that metaphor and get to the sports.</p>
<h5>Horse Racing</h5>
<p>The first jewel of the Triple Crown will be run on June 20, but it won’t be the Kentucky Derby. Instead the Belmont Stakes, normally run third in the sequence, will kick things off.

 But the race won’t look the same as in years past. No fans will pack Belmont’s sweeping grandstands. And with 3-year-old horses having had limited options to race, organizers have decided that asking them to go the Belmont’s famed grueling 1½ miles was too much this year. Instead they will race at a mere 1⅛ miles, making the Belmont the shortest, instead of the longest, Triple Crown race.
 
 Whoever wins the Belmont will have to wait some time to complete the Triple Crown. The Kentucky Derby is set for September and the Preakness for October.</p>
